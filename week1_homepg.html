        <p class="right">Heyo~<br><br>
        My name is Melanie Li and I am majoring in Media Studies with a concentration of Emerging Media and minoring in Computer Science. Initially, I was on my to major in Computer Science, but I realized I wanted to work more towards design, so I switched paths.<br><br>
        In my free time, I enjoy watching anime, reading man(ga/hwa/hua) and webtoons, playing Genshin Impact, and drawing. As a person who loves to visualize, I found myself engaging in two different mediums to produce my art through two-dimensions: traditional and digital. Currently, I am more focused on improving myself with digital illustration which are inspired by a variety of Japanese animations, graphic novels, and RPGs.
